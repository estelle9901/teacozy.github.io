Fictional Tea Shop Website

This project is a fully self-built fictional tea shop website, developed entirely from scratch based on a provided design specification and image assets.

I recreated the design using HTML and CSS without any starter code, implementing all layout, styling, and responsive features according to the specification.

Responsive Layout: Optimized for different screen sizes to ensure a smooth browsing experience across devices.

Pixel-Accurate Design: Followed the design spec closely, including spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy.

Clean HTML & CSS Structure: Semantic HTML markup and organized CSS for maintainability.
